              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>This survey is intended for those students who were residing on campus in April 2021, and were instructed to vacate the campus by 26th April, 2021.
                If you were not on campus at this time, please skip this survey. <br><br>
                This survey is regarding your well being and circumstances in the two weeks from the end of April. The objective of this study is to quantify the impact 
                of the pandemic on the well-being of students, their families and communities; and to understand the impact traveling at this time has had on them.
                In recent trends towards data driven policy making, we hope to collect this data to better inform policy makers and contribute to scientific knowledge 
                that can help us combat COVID-19 collectively. This study is being conducted independently by postgraduate student volunteers of IITK.</p>

              <p>This survey is intended for those students who were residing on campus in April 2021, and were instructed to vacate the campus by 26th April, 2021.
                If you were not on campus at this time, please skip this survey. <br>
                The first part is to be filled one week after leaving campus, and the second two weeks after leaving campus.
                The objective of this study is to understand the impact of students traveling home on their families and communities, at a time when India is combating a deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

              <p class="ui-text-intro"></p>
              <p>
                This study is being conducted independently by postgraduate student volunteers of IITK.
                The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of the pandemic on the well-being of students, their families and communities; and to understand the impact traveling at this time has had on them.
                In recent trends towards data driven policy making, we hope to collect this data to better inform policy makers and contribute to scientific knowledge that can help us combat COVID-19 collectively.</p>
